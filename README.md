# GPT_WEBAPP

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that integrates GPT-3.5 Turbo, a conversational model by OpenAI, into a user-friendly interface. Built using Flask for the backend and React.js for the frontend, the application allows users to interact with the GPT model by creating characters that maintain their role through conversations.

The backend is responsible for user authentication, session management, and interfacing with the GPT API, while the frontend focuses on providing a seamless user experience. State management on the client side is handled using React's built-in useState and useContext hooks.

## Features
User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality.
Interactive UI: A text-based interface for user prompts and GPT-3 responses.
Backend API: Flask-based API for handling GPT-3 calls and user management.
State Management: Uses React's built-in state management for user data.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Flask
Database: MongoDB
Other: Flask-WTF for forms, Flask-Login for session management, OpenAI for GPT-3.5 Turbo API.
